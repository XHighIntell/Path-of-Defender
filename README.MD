# Anniversary
In 2015, with a massive passion for coding I started a  game project to fulfill my freetime. The process pushed by passion in coding, learning, and experiencing new things. Without clear vision and tons of mistakes in messy code. In the end, I made the decision to stop working on it. I had planned to rewrite it from scratch again but that never happened. 

That failure made a big impact in my style of coding still today. And today, I reuploaded this repository to GitHub to remember that day.
